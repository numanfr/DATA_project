Project description - the Optiver7 group has created a project to predict volatility based on the use of feature clustering and the application of the LightGBM model, ARMA-GARCH, HAV and linear regression. The output and features were visualised in a Shiny app with interactive elements allowing the user to view predicted volatility and RMSE across different time IDs and stock IDs. The intended audience is for academics and University students.
How to use the project - running the report.ipynb with the requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt will produce an html file containing our report, which includes screenshots from our app and a link to the Shiny app from the report. All required files have been produced and pushed into the projectâ€™s folder, meaning no external inputs are required. To run the project, a Jupyter notebook environment should be set up.
Configuration - libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib are required to read the csv files into the Jupyter notebook file. Additional dependencies may be required to read in split_norm.fth and tukey.pickle.
Contribution - this project is the joint collaborative work of Michael Podbury, Numan Reshidat, Harry Li, Cody Chan, Yidan Fu and Yimeng Du. The project was created as part of the DATA3888 interdisciplinary assessment designed for Optiver.
